Let me walk you through my train of thought.

Wanted to make best of 2017 list
    ton left to see
    didn't know how much time I had
    it was sooner than I thought
        they should be announcing soon, yeah?

might be fun to guess the day they'll announce
    coding the year, announcement, show date
    only Tues/Wed/Th for shows on Sat/Sun
    No Wed since '93
    27 data points. Average diff w/ stdev = 37 +- 4
    our air date is 3/4/18
    so looking for Tues/Thurs in that range we have
        2018-01-30 1 33
        2018-01-25 3 38
        2018-01-23 1 40

    okay great, so we'll plot it and --

    <plot 1> wat

    <plot 2>did someone not set their alarm clock in 2009?
        bumped from 5 best picture noms to 10

    <plot 3> what's with the break after 2002?

    wiki

ratings
    didn't start paying attention to them until 2013
    was surprised to know that they were, seemingly, a much bigger deal
    cycling through wikipedia pages, interesting to see
        efforts to rebrand
        effects of writer's strike

    on the decline

Before I knew it, an hour had gone by, and despite all of my reading, I wasn't much closer to which of the 3 dates I felt most confident about.

So naturally, I spent my New Year's Day scraping every week of Box Office Data for all of the movies nominated for Best Picture since 1990.
