Last time on DragonBall Z
    Trying to figure out when announcements for Academy Awards were coming around

    some basically-napkin-math later, I'd narrowed it down to 3 dates:
        2018-01-30 1 33 
        2018-01-25 3 38
        2018-01-23 1 40

    In my poking around, I found some really weird shifts in the dates of these announcements, as well as some uninspiring numbers regarding the ratings in recent years.

    If their goal is to get asses in seats watching this thing, it looks like they're not doing a great job.
        But it's hard to blame them. Live-updates are at everyone's fingertips if they care. I like movies and I spent this year's show watching Get Out (worth) and the year before that watching Superbad with some friends (also worth)

    But as I dug into the relationship between the award show and the movies they celebrate, a bigger picture started to unfold.

The Data

        Give them your traffic. they've got the coolest data on the internet.

Premieres
    first thing that stood out to me when I plotted out all of the theater runs was the bunching at the front and back

    trimmed data down to just premieres
        <premieres by day year>

    more interestingly
        over time, it's consolidated more to the back half

    as you might recall from my last post, announcement dates are creeping up
        <picture>

        and now nominee premieres are creeping back

    huh.
        <pictures>

    Slowly inching together like something in a petri dish. must be something here.

    silence of the lambs
        released 2/14/91
        the '90 Oscars nominees were announced 2/13/91
        fittingly, waiting patiently until the time was right, then it sprung from rest and won:
         -best picture
         -best director
         -best actor
         -best actress
         -best adapted screenplay
        and bit some dude's face off

    93 schindler's list saw some nice bump and a long tail

    97 few boring years and then Titanic has a historic showing

    99 how about the time that the Academy literally picked American Beauty out of the trash, brushed the dust off, called 5 second rule and re-released it to more fame that it had originally gotten

        http://www.moviesmetricsmusings.com/2016/12/american-beauty-in-3d-math-y-approach.html

    02 chicago had one of the longest tails of any best picture

    06 departed had a huge release, and then the people who still hadn't gotten around to it were given another shot

    08 slumdog millionaire had a really cool build

    09 first year since the 40s we have more than 5 best pictures
        amid the confusion, hurt locker squeaks out as the lowest grossing best picture winner ever


    And every year after the confusion continues, in an era, I like to call the "Wait, What the Hell Just Won?" Era
        saturation of good movies and blockbusters in tail of the year means that people are making opportunity cost decisions regarding what to see.

        Movies get nominated and see a bump in theaters

        And if they win, they get another hike as people play catchup with the cultural zeitgeist

    2010
        Feels kind of on the nose to have a studder, yeah?

    2011
        Mid-May, they decided to double check

    2012
        Ben Affleck: Star of Gigli, Daredevil, Academy Award Winning Director

    2013
        The Between-Announcement-and-Show hump looks eerily similar for like 5 movies here

    2014
        For my money, jingoism < Michael Keaton < Whiplash

    2015
        Mad Max had 6 Techincal Awards and Doof Man. Moral Victory.

    2016
        Hidden Figures had a damn impressive return ($25M budget vs $170M gross). More impressive yet is that some undetermined theater in the BOM Dataset kept it in their rotation for nearly a year.

So that was fun, but what did we learn?
    Hopefully it helped reinforce the notion that 'oscar-bait' movies are releasing later in the year.

    This leads to many overlapping releases and movies stepping on each others toes.

    However, it's partially mitigated by the announcement/awards themselves, as they see a hike in attendence.

But how important is that announcement?
    Before I can answer that, I needed to get a quick pulse on how the industry was looking

        avg total gross by year
            <pic>

        After 2002-2003, these movies are earning less at the box office (excusing for a moment the year containing the highest grossing movie ever).

        However, if you trace a crude line from 2005 to 2016, things look on the mend, if slightly

        but unaggregating and looking at the movie level
            the data is all over the place

            note, no clear relationship between gross and winning Best Picture

            The average gross is about equal if slightly down. Inflation dollars means this is bad news.

    my main dataset is by movie by week
        cross-referencing that against the announce dates for each award show, I can code all of the money a movie makes as "before the announcement" or "After the announcement"

        Using this, I can comb through each year and build a yearly "Total Gross After Announcement / Total Total Gross" metric and trend that year over year.

        <final pic>

        So as I stated earlier, it's questionable if the Academy is doing a great job treating the job as a 3 hr spectator event. However, if you told me that it was actually their goal is to bouy this corner of the movie industry, I'd be easily conivinced.

Conclusion
    So, going all the way back to the premise of my original post, I'd narrowed down my candidate dates to
        2018-01-23 1 40
        2018-01-25 3 38
        2018-01-30 1 33 

    So to take this train of thought to its logical station
        Academy wants to bolster movies
        They're going to pick a date that nominees
        Golden Globe Nominees make a decent enough proxy, I think (probably a whole other analysis in its own right...)
